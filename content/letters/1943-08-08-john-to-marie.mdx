[United States Army letterhead with eagle insignia]

August 8, 1943

Dear Marie

This may be the last letter that I will be able to write for some time. If it is do not worry. I do not know now what will happen. But remember that I love you and keep writing. The letters will get to me somehow and even if they are old they will read good. Remember to not put anything military in any letter unless you can cover it up. I will read between the lines.

Would like to know what arrangements you have made about going home. How did the apartment work out. Did the girls sell their trailers. How is Patsy. etc.

Didn't receive a letter from you since I got back. Mail may be held up again. Remember to give Patsy a big hug & kiss for her daddy and pray that he won't be gone too long.

Everything is quiet here. My promotion is definitely out and I am now listed as Asst S 3. The colonel said nothing to me. I am not going to do anymore than they order me to do. Things may change after the physical exam but that remains to be seen. In the meantime I will do my job. I do not intend to be S 3 on Ass't S 3 pay. Not for anything. Archie had better learn quick and it's a lot of work. Of course this is between you and me.

Well honey I haven't much more to say for now. Remember how I miss your love & kisses & companionship. Best wife in the world—that's you.

Please tell me your plan on going home. In the meantime much love to you and Patsy.

Your loving husband

John
