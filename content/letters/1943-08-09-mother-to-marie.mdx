Dear Marie + Patsy -

Was real pleased to get your letter to-day and know John had the 5 day furlough at home with you. God is good after all.

I just called about the price of the car and they told me that a car in very good condition up to now they have paid as high as $900.00 but that anytime between now and the 1st of Sept they are going to put a ceiling on cars and that probably the most that would be paid on a car like that would be $700.00. So if John is sure to go your $800.00 price probably is a good one as the prices are going to drop. Is there any chance of John not going? Or is it pretty well settled. I don't suppose you have any idea where they will be sent to. I wish things (I mean this war) would be over soon — the sooner the better.

You didn't mention whether John got the knife Donald sent or not. It was sent to Shreveport to the address you gave me some time ago. Let me know will you if he got it?

I tried to call John Sat night but was told he was on maneuvers and couldn't be reached. Seems so funny I didn't get a line from him. Has he been too busy? I hope if he does go across he will write us one
