September 17, 1943

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

Skipped one letter yesterday because I went to town in the afternoon. Bought a leather wallet & another leather piece which I will mail home to you as soon as possible. Prices in town are exceedingly high and the stores are absolutely bare. Simple little items cost a fortune here and a good number of them are seconds imported from the U.S.

You will be interested in a shopping tour through one of their ten cent stores. Typical of such stores they sold everything from clothing to hardware but actually the goods was poor & the shelves were almost empty. A few bottles of bluing, a shelf of native pottery, a counter with various sized buttons loose in glass dividers, no candy counter (impossible to get here), no crowds or any reason for them to come. What a business old Woolworth could do here with his stores. About the time we had looked about the store & were on the way out, a bell sounded & all the girls who worked behind the counters hastened to cover the counters & rush out while a bouncer at the door saw that everyone left the store quickly. All the stores on closing have heavy metal shields which pull down to protect the windows from thieves.

Got my ration of candy for one week today! One package of life savers, one package of assorted wafers, 2 packages of gum. Of course that is plenty for me but heaven help me if I was a candy lover.

Received your letter of the 2nd of Sept and could almost taste the good food that the Scots put out. Sure made me hungry. This dehydrated food is nothing like that.

By the way do all you can for the American Red Cross. They are 100%. They run a snack bar over here with food, coffee, lemonade, fresh bakery, etc. They pass out bags of miscellaneous items such as books, gum, sewing kits etc. They have treated all of us 100%. Showers are available at the Red Cross, movies and a place to read or write, etc.

Miss you all (Patsy & Marie) very very much. Hope you will forgive me for not writing yesterday. Your loving husband John (over)

I love you my sweetheart & only hope for the day when I can be with you again. Pray hard that that day will be soon. John
