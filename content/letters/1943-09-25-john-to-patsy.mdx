Dearest Patsy (have mother read it to you)

It has been a dreadfully long time since I have seen you and I hope that you have not forgotten me by now. Of course I know that it will not take long, once I get home, to win your love again, but I would appreciate it if you would remember me. Your mother has told me that you feel a little strange with all those uncles and aunts around, and I must confess that I often felt that way myself. Sometimes if I could just get away from all the noise for a while, it would help me.

The main reason for my writing to you, however, is to find out if you have been a good girl. Goodness only knows that you must be for mother must have time to think of me—at least once & awhile. Don't forget about going to bed early and laying quiet like you used to do when I put you to bed. Don't cry sassy like and make your mother pick you up, for then you will spoil your lovely nature. In short, little sweetheart try to be the best girl possible. Now I know that this is sometimes impossible but with no papa to be there to spank you when you are bad, such practice is dangerous.

Will close now, Patsy, with love to you and mother. And if mother should skip reading her letter for today let her read this one too.

Loads of love

Your Daddy.
