September 26, 1943

Dearest Marie & Patsy

Just a short note to let you know that I am thinking of you. Today I had a detail so I am writing this by flashlight. Very difficult trying to hold the light in one hand and write with the other. But don't want you to be without a letter.

Went to mass & communion today (Sunday) and offered up the mass for you and Patsy, for your intention and for myself. Incidentally the masses here are offered for us and it is the same as if we had a mass said in any church at home. They are all offered for you and Patsy.

The priest in his sermon gave us one wonderful thought based on a Prayer written by Joyce Kilmer. The poem speaks about how heavy the pack is on his back (he was a soldier in the last war) so much lighter the Cross upon his back. His feet are sore from walking, and he meditates on the pierced feet of Christ. Men cuss him & call him vile names and he meditates on the blasphemy offered Christ on the Cross. Then the priest said to us: Do good now and live a Catholic life for it would be too bad if we would carry the Cross and not receive the reward. Good night my loved ones. God bless you

John
