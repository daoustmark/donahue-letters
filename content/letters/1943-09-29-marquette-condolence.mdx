**MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN**

**OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT**

Sept. 29, 1943

My dear Captain:

I just learned of the death of your mother, and I write to convey to you and to your family our sincere sympathy in this great loss. What you will value more, I give you the assurance of our prayers. The members of the Jesuit community will give your mother a special memento in their Masses and other prayers, and she will be recommended to the prayers of the students at their Masses on Sunday, as is our custom at the death of our alumni or their near relatives.

The death of mother brings with it one of the most poignant sorrows we can be called upon to bear. That sorrow is accentuated in your case since you are separated from your loved one. I know, however, that you find consolation in the firm confidence your Faith gives you that your loss is your mother's gain, since death admitted her to the reward of her good life. You may well think, too, that she will be watching over you and guarding you in the difficulties and dangers which you may encounter since, close to God, she will be in a position to intercede very effectively in your behalf.

I hope that you find things in the service to your liking. That you are successful in it is evident, and I congratulate you on that success.

Yours very sincerely,

Raphael C. McCarthy, S.J.

Captain John Donahue
1704 East Irving Place
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
