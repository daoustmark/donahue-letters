October 21, 1943

Dearest Marie & Patsy

Received letter with proofs of Patsy dated the 27th of Sept and a letter dated the 26th of Sept. and a V mail dated October 9th yesterday. Today I received a V mail dated October 11. Must be you skipped Sunday. I skipped yesterday on the letter deal because I went to town but I made up for it by shipping a large package of gifts to you. Don't know how you will like them but I hope they appeal to you. But I will tell you about them in the course of this letter.

We arrived in town about 2 oclock in the afternoon and after having a bite to eat in the officer's club, I left the rest of the officers and went to visit the Cathedral of Joan of Arc. You know, of course, that Joan of Arc is the patron Saint of France. As one approaches the cathedral they will see the large golden statue of the saint perched upon a golden horse. She is clothed in armor and has a shield and lance. This statue is situated in a small park which is located directly in front of the cathedral proper. The cathedral towers high above the park—49 steps up by actual count. The front of the building itself is in the form of a great arch which is decorated by pictures of the Blessed Trinity on the very top and angels on each side along the sides of the arch. All these representations are done in colored tile work and contrast beautifully against the sand color of the building itself. A beautiful iron fence, with gates for entrance to each of the five doors, contrasts against the pastel colors of the arch and light brown doors.

As one enters the church, the eye is met with a large stone altar which is fenced off from the rest of the church and is raised up from by floor by about two feet. Instead of the kneeling benches and seats, there are straight back chairs and a few kneelers in front. As you approach the altar, the rich upholstering of the chairs within the sanctuary are visible and the red plush stands out brilliantly. Hand carved furniture is much in evidence. The floor is covered by a beautiful oriental rug of a multicolored pattern (similar to the rug I am sending you. Oddly enough several little boys, obviously altar boys, dressed in red cassocks and white surplices and set off by a red cardinal's hat, were whispering and talking near the front of the church. In rear of the altar was a beautiful grotto and altar set within that grotto, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.

Flowers of all kinds were there in decoration. Numerous marble thanksgivings were hung on the wall around the structure with the words "Merci, Marie." (thank you Mary) or "Remembrance Mary"

The right and left sides of the church had small altars to Saint Joseph and the Blessed Virgin set off in small alcoves on the sides. These alcoves took the size of small chapels and the one to the Virgin Mary had the Real Presence indicated by a light in the form of a heart with a cross on it. Lovely flowers and more Merci's were evident.

To the rear of the church on either side there was an altar to St Peter on one side and Joan of Arc on the other and another altar to Mary.

The confessional, St Vincent de Paul Society and the alms box were very familiar things to see. Stained glass windows of beautiful color cast a color over the floor of the church while the soft light shining down from each of the four domes that form the roof of the building gave a welcome and soothing glow. The whole atmosphere was one of quiet splendor and reverence, however, the constant flow of non-catholic visitors

Next I visited shop after shop and after looking about could find nothing to buy. I finally wandered into a shop and with the assistance of five clerks, all jabbering at the same time, I bought the third item in your package—a beautiful, all wool, Algerian, Persian rug. The guarantee and trade mark of the rug is on the back of the handwork. It is guaranteed to be hand made. The design is similar to the rug on the floor of the sanctuary in the cathedral of Joan of Arc. (Jeane d'Arc.)

After all that shopping I again returned to the officer's club, had a bite to eat and again meet the rest of the officers. After a short time we proceeded to a theater where we attended a stag show put on by a group of army boys entitled "10 minute Break." It was a musical comedy and was very amusing.

The theater was of the continental type, very small but very high. There were three balconies. Private boxes flanked the stage on either side and boxes with private entrances circled the whole theater at ground level. These boxes were partitioned off by high walls covered with red plush. Leather covered swinging doors provided the entrance doors.

The roof of the theater was formed by a large dome which was decorated very colorfully. The curtain was a beautiful silk colored by peacocks with colored tails. The interior was a cream color and everything formed to represent carving. Maroon curtains were used in the private boxes for decorative purposes.

Well honey, it is hard to even attempt to give you a hundred per cent description of these things but I am sure you will at least have some idea of them. This all would be so much more enjoyable if we were seeing it together and the world was not at war. But when this war ends, I will be happy just to stay with you and love you dearly. I still miss you terribly and hope you miss me. Don't worry and don't dye your hair. Closing now with loads of love & kisses.

Your loving husband John.
