November 12, 1943

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

Another day is done and we are one day closer to reunion. Oh Happy day! Received no letters today but am hoping for the best tomorrow. Am living a very easy life these days with electric light, good food and a heated tent. Don't know how long all this will last but it certainly feels good. See now, you don't have to feel quite so sorry for me at least for the present. And incidentally I am quite far out of the danger area, so you don't have to worry very much either.

The nights are getting quite cold but the sun during the daytime lends a happy glow to the situation. Today I took a cold water shower (the first in many a day). There comes a time in every man's life when he can't stand himself any longer, and then he must shower, cold water or not. I had reached that miserable stage.

Last night I sent your silk scarf in an air mail envelope. Sure hope it goes through OK. Paid 3 dollars for it. I can tell you that because I'm afraid you won't appreciate its value if I don't. As yet I have not had a chance to send your coral necklace or the other cameos. I know that you will appreciate the necklace because it is much like that dime store jewelry you used to try to tease me with. Remember.

When we get to Rome I will buy some more souvenirs and gifts for you. Can't imagine what they have there, but I know they must have their specialty. Naples, you know, has its cameos and silk goods. Perhaps you can find someone who knows what the specialty is in that city.

Incidentally, I think the travel experience I am getting is going to be invaluable. Sometime when we get the money, I would like to take you on the same trip I have made so far. As a tourist I think I could show you many interesting and beautiful things. But we will plan that trip later. I sure hope I get to see Berlin so we can add that to our trip.

It is very instructional to see the different peoples of this great world at their worst and at their best. Certainly the great soul of Italy has never been laid bare as it has been now. Surely the heart of a people is never shown as clearly as it is during this time of destruction & pillage. So seeing these sights, listening to the people as they lick their wounds, observing the courage and heart of a people, is going to make me a wiser man than I was when I left the good old U.S.A.

I know that you want to know something about Naples since I have mentioned that I have been able to see that city in my travels. It is true that our enemy has destroyed a great deal but even in this destruction, the beauty of the city is apparent. The huge harbor that gathers the blue Mediterranean Sea into its arms, is a beautiful sight, since it sparkles with romance & glamour. One can almost picture the place in peace time with ships from all over the world, gracing its docks and quays. The rocky and forbidding isle of Capri, famed in song, raises its back out of the sea in the mouth of this harbor, and only when the sun descends in the West does one appreciate the beauty of its rocky shores. This is a city of castles and palaces, where mighty kings and princes once controlled the traffic of the inland sea. The city raises up from its beaches to high pinnacles in a short distance. Beautiful villas and rocky castles grace every hill. The hills are terraced and gardens of flowers dot the rocky ledges. Here and there a church steeple towers high above the city carrying the cross on high, for this is a country of numerous and beautiful churches. Naples, city of ruin and destruction, but also in its destruction, a city of beauty and romance. Bombs cannot destroy what centuries of civilization have built.

The people are gradually going back to a normal life. You have read perhaps that the electricity has been restored in part. Business people have salvaged what the German has left or what they managed to hide, and display them for sale. Here and there a pair of silk stockings is displayed, or a fancy silk negligee. But the stores are very empty and only a pretense of former business is possible. As one walks down the street, a civilian will try to sell the family jewels, a fountain pen, a watch, a pistol or anything in order to get a few lire. Street hawkers invite you to a spagette dinner or cognac or signorina as you will have it. Religious trinkets are sold like carnival goods on the street corners. Every fourth business place is a barber shop yet strangely enough all the civilians need hair cuts. Kids follow one and beg for candy, cigarettes or anything you may give them. Thus one finds Naples these days, the busy salesman and beggar.

This part of the letter is for you, Marie, my sweet and darling wife. Of course you know that there is nothing in this crazy, topsy turvy world that means a darn thing, without you waiting for me back there. Even the things I have seen would mean a hundred per cent more if you were there to see them with me. And the only reason why I am able to have peace of mind at all, over here far away from you and all that is sweet and dear, is because I know that you will be waiting for me on that happy day of return with a welcome smile and loving kiss, sweet as ever, true to the last, and ready to resume our happy and successful life together. No more war to bother us, only a job to do together—namely, to make a home and raise a family. Darling, there is nothing sweeter to think about, nothing better to dream of than you and our future.

Life has been kind to me and, though at present it is a bit bitter, mainly because I am away from you. But I cannot help but remember the happy days it has given me. The memory of our courtship, our years of marriage, our little angel from heaven Patsy, our complete success of marriage, fill me with a happy glow. We have so much to look forward to, so much to live for, so much to hope for that every fiber of my soul aches for the days to come.

I know, sweetheart, that separation is hard for you because you have much less to do and see, only the same old routine. But the emptiness of that separation will be overwhelmed and forgotten when we are together again. Remember what the good book says about a woman who bears her child in pain, soon forgets the agony of birth for joy of a son born to her. Thus the agony of our separation will soon be forgotten for joy of our happy reunion. My prayer and yours should be one for a quick and safe reunion in the near future and a continued happy married life. Your prayers and communions have helped me much, I know. Please continue them for they are certainly evidence of your strong and blessed love for me. Only God can grant us the favors we so earnestly ask, and we can only ask by constant and fervent prayer.

I have extended myself much in this letter tonight but I hope you can understand my love for you. Nothing is harder than expression of that love in words, so forgive my lack of expression. When we are together, I can express it much more vividly by actions. Goodnite sweetheart. Dream of me. Your loving husband John
