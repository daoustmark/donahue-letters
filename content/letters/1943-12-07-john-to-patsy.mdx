December 7, 1943

Dear Patsy,

Received several of your pictures just recently and although they were but snapshots, I can see that you are rapidly growing up to be a very big girl. Furthermore I see that you are walking and able to get around more than when I last saw you. Mother tells me that you have been a very good little girl, and that pleases me because daddy wants a well behaved daughter when he gets home.

Its rather hard to realize that I must talk to you like the big girl you are, because when I left you were just a tiny babe. But time makes everyone grow, I guess, and before we know it you will be having boy friends coming over to visit you. And don't forget when they do they must leave by 11:30. So there.

Santa Claus will be coming soon and I understand that you are going to see him sometime before Christmas. Now that guy has a big book and he writes down every time you are a bad girl and also every time you are a good girl. You better get a good record started because he works almost entirely on that big book. And just a tip from experience, be sure and hang up a big stocking on Christmas. You know yours are quite small. So borrow mam mas for that night. Here's hoping you get a big lot of gifts on Christmas.

Well will close now with love and a great big kiss for you.

Love

Daddy
