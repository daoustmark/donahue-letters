January 8, 1944

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

No mail today but again I have hopes of a good sized mail bag tomorrow. Seems as if the mail man slights me very frequently these days, but I know that there is plenty of mail stacking up for me someplace.

Tomorrow is Sunday and I will go to mass and communion. Since we have been in this vicinity the opportunity to attend mass has been very frequent. I have told you about the little church that is nearby. It is a beautiful little chapel with the same fixtures as any American Catholic church. One feels completely at home. Luckily enough the Germans left the tabernacle in the altar and all the vestments and articles of worship. Shell fire has not touched the place and it is an excellent place for worship. Of course the Real Presence is not kept there because of the fact that it might be destroyed but there is mass there twice daily at 0830 and 1730 hrs.

Strangely enough the priest formerly had a parish in Natchitoches, Louisiana. You remember the town where Pete and Minnie had a place for some time. He is a short, dark and rather handsome fellow and quite nice to talk to. Says he got the idea of becoming an army chaplain from watching the soldiers on maneuvers near his parish in Louisiana. Every night after mass, Father has benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and we all sing O Salutaris Hostia and Tantum Ergo. Tonight we all chimed in on Holy God We Praise Thy Name. Every service finds the Italian women in attendance but very few of the menfolk. Don't understand it.

Since we have first arrived at this area quite some time ago, we have been able to see quite a bit of change for the better. The people are happier and better fed and they have cleaned themselves up and are gradually bringing out their better clothes. Most of the women wear black day in and day out. Some of these women are quite pretty in their own sort of way, but according to American standards they wouldn't even make first base. They are a hard working crew of farm people and have the characteristics of farm women. The men are weak looking, not only physically but weak willed. The reason for that is perhaps this - that all the physically fit and hardy men have gone to the army and only the inevitable 4F's remain.

There is one young man in this community who took rather drastic methods of avoiding the draft. He tied a piece of raw beef on his kneecap and allowed it to rot. In the process of rotting it infected his knee so bad that when he was called it was swollen to an enormous size. Several of the older men here speak "American" as they put it. Usually one will find that they either lived in Brooklyn or somewhere in New York.

Today I was talking to one of them, and during the course of conversation, I mentioned the fact that I could not understand why people came back to Italy after living in the U.S. He answered that very well I thought when he said simply that he had been born in Italy and that was his home. I guess one gets the wrong idea of these foreign countries. He probably feels the same about Brooklyn as I felt about Naples - it was wonderful but Jimmy how I would like to be home again!

According to Old Mike, one of these English speaking Italians (native of Brooklyn) the weather here takes a sudden turn for the better after January 20. Of course as usual the weather here is very unusual. There is a story going around that these people didn't even know what ice was until they saw it this year. Actually that is a lot a bunk, I think. The cold really isn't bad during the daytime but it gets very biting during a clear night.

For some reason or other the moon is more beautiful here than it is back home. Perhaps that is because its light is diffused throughout the area by the reflection of the light on the snow-covered mountains which would be interesting to you and I. As it is the effect is all lost.

Remember the trench coat I bought from Wiley Beane in Camp Gruber. Well, I decided that since I had the new coat I told you about in a previous letter, that I would get rid of it. So I gave it to the first Italian boy I saw. He happen to be the right size & shape. Well, maybe you know how nice it is to give to the needy but I never experienced a more sincere expression of gratitude in my life. This boy practically kissed me after I made him understand it was his. He couldn't understand me and I couldn't understand him. But he pointed and asked "Italiano?" Or in other words was it an Italian made coat. But I answered "Americano" and he almost clapped his hands with glee. Then he asked "you, vino?" (or do you want some wine) I refused politely and he bowed himself out very happy. That to me was worth a whole lot and I felt very good about the whole thing. Today I noticed he had washed the coat & had it out drying in the sun.

Well, darling, that will give you some ideas of the things we find here in this foreign land. It is strange to find people are so much like ourselves even though they speak a foreign tongue
