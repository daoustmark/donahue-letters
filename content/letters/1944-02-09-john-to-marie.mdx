February 9, 1944

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

No mail from you for four long days and is my morale low. But I have the consolation and, that is, that somewhere my mail is waiting for me. I did not write yesterday because I felt a little bit ill - stomach disorder. I am feeling quite a bit better today. No cause to worry. There is difficulty I had back in the states off and on. I know that you will excuse me.

Archie & I are billeted in a Italian home at the present time. The people are very kind and considerate. They treat us like big shots and are most anxious to please. For example in the morning they have hot water ready in a wash stand with soap and towel. They bring a bronze full of hot water in to us in the evening. They also do our laundry and clean the room. We have the best room in the house and though we don't have electric lights it is very pleasant & comfortable. Of course like all Italian families they have scobs of bambinos, ranging in age from infants to grown up children. Unlike the lazy bed Italian, they are quite healthy and rosy cheeked children. They seem very well fed and quite happy. In fact they feed C ration meat & vegetable stew to their dog. They of course have grown their own food and have not gone hungry. Their clothes are ragged and they haven't shoes for the children, but they are happy as anyone could want to be.

The other evening I was going to my room when one of the families, Incidentally the wine was served as a [illegible] glass and on a white plate as a serving tray. Then the whole family gathered around the fireplace & watched me drink the wine. It is very unfortunate that I have not learned foreign languages. It would be very helpful. Of course I understand a few words and can usually get the content of what they say, but I am unable to express myself. That is one thing I want to do when I get home, is study a few foreign tongues.

These people make their own wool thread using a spinning wheel to accomplish the job. I watched one woman while she spun and it looks rather difficult. I guess one must have very nimble fingers in order to accomplish the job. The carpenter who makes the spinning wheels lives in the same building. He works from hay until night making these things. I think that the Germans destroyed those that they had before.

We ran into one old Italian man who speaks fair English. After talking with him for a while, he finally told us that he had worked in the Ford Plant in Detroit, Mich. It is surprising how many of the older Italian men have been to either the U.S. or Canada, and then returned to their homes & families. One would think that they would hate to return to a country like this. But after all this is their home, and it is the same as the U.S. is to us.

Had the privilege of seeing one of the old churches in Italy just recently. Of course actually it is a comparatively modern church for this country. The corner stone said it was built in 1741. Imagine the history behind a church like that. The main altar is ruined and the roof has many gaping holes in it. However, in spite of the ruin, there is a certain beauty about it.

The main alter is set much higher than the rest of the church, and is formed of marble. Around the alter in a half moon shape we hand carved chairs and a sign above this section is worded "Chorus". A small organ is built directly behind the altar. Above the altar and [illegible] a dome shaped roof, is a beautifully painted wall picture.

The main part of the church has approximately eight smaller altars. Above each is an old painting and behind the painting, in an alcove is a statute. I don't know why the statues is there except that it is probable that the statutes we exposed only on certain feast days and during certain months of the year.

On either side of the main altar are rooms which once served as a sacristy and, here we found vestments of all colors and designs. A multitude of religious articles were scattered about, ranging from prayer books to small statues. A few looking beads, holy pictures and even a gold monstrance were laying about. It would be a shame to Liberians of these things. (Pause- one of the Italian boys just brought the hot coals in for the evening. I told him I was writing to my family and showed him pictures of you and Patsy. He said "ah bon, bon bambino". They really are crazy about kids.

The other day I went into the town and by chance I saw among the ruins a beautiful oil painting of St. Joseph & the child Jesus. I would & have really enjoyed having the picture for it was a fine work of art. But I could not salve my conscience enough to justify my taking it. One of the boys did take it, however and is going to send it home. It is probably worth four or five hundred dollars if not more.

The same thing happened to me not so long ago when I came upon a beautiful hand [illegible] marble table cover. It was a very valuable piece but I just could not see myself taking it. I had seen the same thing in Haflor priced up to two and three hundred dollars. Someone got that piece too. I guess we are just too honest. But I would rather pay for the things I get and not have as much as the other fellow.

Well honey, will close this little account of a few interesting experiences with many loving thoughts of you and Baby from your loving & devoted husband

John
