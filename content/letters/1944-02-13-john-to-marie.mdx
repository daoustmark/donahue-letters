February 13, 1944

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

Tonight I had the singular honor of enjoying a meal with an Italian family. It all happened this way. As I have told you in previous letters I am staying in a house with an Italian family. There are so many Italians living in this house that I really don't know where family lines start and end. But for the sake of brevity I will write about the one group I consider a family.

There is first Luigi whom I have pegged as a stay boarded and father of the oldest girl in the family proper. There is Julio and Maria who are youngsters of about eighth grade age. There is Paulina, Luigi's own, and a number of others whom I will leave nameless, first because I don't remember their names, and second because they are just like the atmosphere surrounding the incident that I am going to tell you about.

I was seated in my room, taking my Italian lesson from Luigi when he was called to supper by Maria. He asked me if I would eat with him but I politely declined. But he begged & pleaded with me until I finally gave in to his wishes. And so we entered the dining room in the lower part of the house, and there met the family. It was almost breath-taking how pleased everyone was. They all jumped up and offered me a chair by the fireplace, and then began talking and waving their arms exhibiting childlike enthusiasm. It all seemed very polite and yet strangely touching.

After a very short time they set the dishes on the table, and filled them with spagetti and beans. I begged off with a very small dish partly due to the fact that I was not hungry, and still more because I didn't think their food would be very appetizing. But strangely enough it did taste rather good. The bread they served was dark and without a spread. The drink was red wine or as they know it "vin rouge". After the main dish they served a salad of greens and a dressing of oil and vinegar. And believe it or not they had a table cloth and napkins; nice glasses added to the table set up.

After the meal they invited me to sit by the fireplace and the whole family gathered about and enjoyed the heat of the glowing embers in the fire. The room was very dimly lighted by a kerosene light and was sparsely furnished. A table, chairs, a few cooking utensils, and a few pictures completed the furnishings of the room. The fireplace is the main center of attraction and the cook stove as well as the heating unit. You probably cannot realize the difficulty of trying to appear sociable when you don't speak a language but it is almost an insurmountable difficulty. One feels like a bump on a log. That is the one thing that impels me to attempt to learn the language. It is such a helpless feeling to be unable to talk to people. However with my limited vocabulary and a vigorous use of hands and a smattering of French and English I was able to talk to them a little. And they are so anxious to help.

Luigi is quite an interesting character. I should judge him to be about thirty years of age. He is slim, short and dark and looks much like any of the other Italian men. He has a very strong personality and is most polite & gracious. He speaks French and German and is learning English at the same time he teaches me Italian. By trade he is a railroad man but since the war he has turned to carpentry. He spends a good part of his day working on spinning wheels and other useful gadgets. His intelligence is much higher than the people he associates with. Like almost all Italian men, he is a former soldier and has served a long period in the army. He insists that he was not a fascist and that he did not follow Mussolini. Of course all Italians deny Mussolini now that he is no longer in power. They dismiss their former leader with a sign of cutting his throat.

The tools that Luigi works with are quite crude. The Germans took his lathe and hand drills. He has improvised various tools to take their place. One tool, a drill, he improvised out of a shaft, a piece of rope and a piece of wood. But despite the lack of tools, his work is very fine and I'm sure he would do excellent cabinet work. So much for Luigi.

The Italians give us good room service where we are. They bring in a wash stand complete with soap & towel every morning, and a burner with hot coals every evening. They are most generous with their services and would perhaps do more if we ask them.

Menu today was very good. For breakfast I had toast, coffee, dehydrated egg omlet and a vitamin pill (Dinky). Meat loaf, mashed potatoes, peas & carrots, bread, butter, coffee, supper. Beef stew, kidney beans, pears, bread, apple butter, tea.

There is perhaps no thing in this world quite so alluring as Italian mud. Without exaggeration, it sticks to one's feet in big clods, making one's feet appear several times larger than normal. When it is mixed with sufficient quantities of water it becomes like gray colored paint and has the unhappy quality of splashing as one walks. When it rains half is almost impossible to keep from getting muddy from head to foot. If one does not change clothes almost daily, it would appear as if he had taken a header in a large mud puddle. You can imagine our difficulties.

Of course this is not the rainy season. The only difference is that now it rains only twice a week while in the rainy season it rains six days out of five.

Well honey, I think I will close this letter letter and you early this morning with much love to you and Patsy. I think of you continually. May God keep you and bless you. Your loving & devoted husband

John
