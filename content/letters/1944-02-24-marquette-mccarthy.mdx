**MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY**
**MILWAUKEE, 3, WISCONSIN**

February 24, 1944

**OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT**

My dear Captain:

It was surely good to receive your letter of February 10th which made a rapid passage from Italy and which I read with great pleasure and edification. I must confess that I did not place you very definitely until I had looked up your record in the Registrar's office. With that help, I now have a very distinct memory of you, and the record is surely one of which you can be very proud. We are looking forward to the day when you will be back to complete your studies in the Law School. You and the other Marquette boys are included in our prayers, in which we ask God to be very good to you and bring you home safe.

Surely the Army life is not blunting your sense of spiritual values, and your example is a vast benefit to both Catholics and non-Catholics around you. When the enlisted men see their captain so faithful to his religion, they are both encouraged and inspired to devote themselves more earnestly also.

You probably knew Father Johnston, who may have taught you in Liberal Arts. He died last week after three years' illness from a heart condition. Father Keegan, who has suffered very much from ulcers of the stomach for many years had a past drastic operation at the Mayo Clinic two weeks ago but, to the astonishment of the doctors, he has recovered to a point where he will be leaving the hospital in the immediate future. I have long passed the customary time for tenure of office, and next Monday Marquette University will have a new rector. You probably have some Marquette men with you or may meet them occasionally and, when you do, I should be very much obliged to you if you would remember me to them very kindly and tell them we are not forgetting them here.

Our educational program is going along as well as can be expected in the circumstances. Fortunately for us, most of our service men are in the Navy. I say that because the Army is withdrawing all the students who have been in the ASTP, with the exception of the boys in medicine, dentistry, and advanced engineering. We also have Army men in medicine and dentistry and they will remain.

The going over in Italy is pretty tough, according to the reports that we get in the newspapers, and probably they do not represent conditions as difficult as they undoubtedly are. If you find time, I shall certainly be glad to hear from you again and, were you to address your letter to Marquette, it will be forwarded to me. I was interested at your observations on the Catholicity of the Italian people. They agree with those that I myself made when I was in Italy in 1924. Perhaps when these Italian men see how American soldiers and American officers practice their religion they will be weaned away from the idea that the Church is an institution for the women and children. If I or any of us here can ever be of any assistance to you, I hope that you will do us the favor of giving us the opportunity to help you. With kind regards, I am

Yours very sincerely,

Raphael C. McCarthy, S. J.
