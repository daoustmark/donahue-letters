March 23, 1944

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

I stood in the window high above the valley and watched the sun set. Long shadows grew darker behind the rocky hills and distant mountains turned dark purple. The green valley, with its rivers and ponds, blended softly into the foothills of the mountains. Here and there a pond of water shone golden from the rays of a blood red sun, and a soft yellowish haze settled softly over the valley. Before me at my feet and disappearing into an olive grove was an old rocky road. A few buildings faintly visible through the trees caught the last rays of the sun and reflected them, giving these old buildings the appearance of some ethereal houses. All was quiet and peace reigned while God saw the world being put to slumber.

And suddenly as if to break the spell the valley flashed and roared with artillery fire. Startled birds screaming wildly, flew hurried & disturbed courses past my window. A pall of smoke rose to blot out the rays of the dying sun. Echoes rocked the valley and boomed between hills & mountains and sharp lightning like flashes pierced the gathering darkness. And I thought as I watched that a sacrilege had been committed for man had disturbed God's communion with the earth. The rude and unnatural sounds of battle broke the spell of the moment. It was all so senseless. The only way out of harmony was man. It is times like these that I have such a desire for peace and home.

I have told you many times before about the table on which I write many of my letters. This table is walnut and has a beautiful glass-like finish. There is only one thing wrong with it. As I sit here writing persistent little termites eat away at it. Every now & then the table will crack loudly. At first I could not believe my ears but there is no doubt that little by little the table is being eaten away.

Now isn't that about the strangest thing you have ever heard. Jimmy I'm glad I don't have a wooden leg.

Finally located another German helmet and a German gas mask. On my trip to the batteries today I talked to some of the men. They knew where some of them were and Sunday they will bring them with them when they come to church. Now all I must do is to get the old man's approval to send them home and I will be ready to send out the box. Simple.

Had quite an amusing incident happen tonight. I was getting ready to shave and I sat on my bed stropping my razor. If you remember it makes quite a slapping noise. Well I had barely started when an English soldier stuck his head in the door and said "It would not be a Galls ye are stropping now would it?" I replied that it was. "Makes me feel mighty like home" said he. "I lost my Galls in Africa and haven't been able to purchase another, ceptin but once when I could of got one for four pounds ten shillings. But it twere about ten years old."

Upon further conversation with him I learned that he was an Irishman who had left south Ireland, lived in the north and finally moved to London. He has been in the army for quite a long time but is plenty sick of it just as I am.

These English soldiers are really quite interesting "chaps".
