Dearest Marie & Patsy

Just a line to accompany this letter. These enclosures are some things I would like to have you keep for me. One is the last letter I received from my mother before her death, one the notification of her death from you, a third with the note about Patsy taking her first step and the last a letter from Father McCarthy.

Everything is O.K and I am really feeling fine. Went to devotions today Good Friday and heard reading from the Passion, and Stationes [stations] of the cross.

I'm sending the letter "free" to see how soon you receive it. Please tell me how long it takes. Just an experiment.

Darling I love you very very much and hope that you love me the same way. Fond kisses from your loving & devoted husband

John

I love you
