June 19, 1944

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

If I remember correctly I promised to write a longer than usual letter on my sight-seeing experience in Rome. Tonight – or rather this morning (0300hrs) I am on duty with nothing to do so I might as well keep that promise.

This is the first time that we have stopped to take a breath since the long days of Cassino, and believe me I am almost breathless. But here you are on my sight seeing tour.

As we enter the Eternal city it is surprising to see how modern and American the, villas and homes appear one might be entering any large American city. Notable was the fact that there was no damage from bombs or shell fire. Down the wide boulevard as far as the eye could see were beautiful tall buildings and apartment houses. But most surprising of all was the crowds of people who lined the curbs cheering, laughing & talking, and throwing flowers at the soldiers as they passed. It was truly a spontaneous celebration.

Perhaps you visualize those people as I did before coming to Italy. But if not perhaps you will get the idea that they are like the people of southern Italy that I have often described in my letters. Well surprising as it may seem the people I saw in Rome could have been seen on the streets of New York, Chicago or Milwaukee, and they would not look out of place. The men were dressed in stylish suits and were neat & clean for the most part. The younger women were well dressed (including silk hose, no less) good looking (blondes/red heads/brunettes); the older women were also well dressed and making lie of the old belief that Italian women grow fat & shapeless after they reach thirty. You will notice that I mention the subject of women! Actually I would not be honest with you if I would omit this point for it was part of the glamour and thrill of seeing Rome. You see, it seemed good to see well dressed and good looking people, apparently unharmed by the war. It was like dropping in on an American city – a part of home. It wasn't that we even cared to know one of these people but it was good to see them. Don't know if I make myself clear or not. Probably sounds quite incoherent.

But to get back to my sight-seeing tour. We left the bus on which we were riding & walked to the Vatican. It was my first time in years (can't remember how long ago) that I have walked. It was really good to be using my legs again & I'm hoping some day you encourage my footsore painful walk to the Basilica & St. Peter's Church. We were met at the entrance to St. Peter's Square by soldiers who conducted us in & gave us a rapid tour thru the Vatican galleries. The walls, ceilings, floors & woodwork of rooms thru which we passed are covered with huge marble sculptures, old masters, frescoes, mosaics, rare tapestries, mirrors, carved wood, bronze, gold, statues & many other artistic & beautiful works of art. But nowhere did we see any bomb or battle scars. A lovely sight to see after all the rubble & ruin we have observed for the past year & 7 months.

After visiting the Vatican art galleries we proceeded into St. Peter's Church. As I have probably mentioned in the past, or as you might already know thru your own reading & study, St. Peter's is one of the largest & most beautiful churches in the world. The main altar is in the center of the church & all around are smaller side altars & chapels – each one a work of art in itself. Mosaic pictures of the saints (colored stone & glass work) decorate the walls, arches & ceiling. These mosaics are done very expertly & unless one gets quite close to the picture he does not realize that it is made of small pieces of stone & glass. Among the outstanding art works are the lovely bronze doors at the front entrance to the church, Michelangelo's Pieta (statue of the dead Christ with the Blessed Mother), lovely ornamental roof are all works of art in themselves. In the front of the church is the main altar and beneath this altar is the crypt of St Peter. If one were to enter this crypt, he would have to descend a number of steps and would then be facing a pair of wrought iron doors in front of which kneel the sculptured figure of a man praying. Around this stair case and in a semi-circle are a great number of candle holders which are kept filled with candles & burning constantly.

The altar is a plain stone & marble structure, and is elevated above the level of the floor. The priest saying mass faces the congregation which incidentally must stand. There are no pews. Around the sides of the interior are many side altars and also large sculptured figures of the saints.

But as much for the cathedral itself for my most thrilling experience was the audience with the Pope.

When we arrived at St Peter's Square we met a Dominican priest who urged us to hurry – that the Pope was having an audience and that we should attend. Needless to say we followed his directions and were soon hurrying up the long flight of stairs, passed the Swiss guard (they saluted smartly) and into the large audience hall.

The hall is a large place and is resplendent with murals and other artistic decoration. The famous Michelangelo spent seven years on scaffolds, lying on his back decorating this room and the adjoining Sistine Chapel. (Unfortunately the Sistine Chapel was locked) The paintings in these two rooms are world famous.

On one end of the hall on a platform was the chair for the Pope and a microphone for the P.A. system. Chamberlains dressed in scarlet pantaloons and Capes passed out rosaries, gifts from the Pope and blessed by him.

We waited for about one hour before things started happening. Finally two of the Swiss guards entered the room and placed themselves on either side of the platform. These guards carried long spears with hatchet attachment. The weapon looked something like this:

As you can see I am not an artist. But I guess this gives you the idea.

The guards were dressed in uniforms of a spangled gold & blue with a scarlet underjacket showing through. The pantaloons continued down to the ankle. They wore a feuless type helmet that was bent up in front & in back. Quite a classy kid!

After a short time more guards entered followed by the dignitaries of the Vatican state all in their whitelacy uniforms complete with medals – and last of all the Pope dressed in a white cassock and a white skull cap. (The same as his pictures show him. Someone started clapping & the rooms echoed with applause. When it stopped the Pope spoke. He welcomed us to Rome & reminded us that even though we were soldiers all Christians were one. And he repeated several times "We are one". He spoke in English. Then he blessed all religious articles we had with us. (I had the rosaries that I had purchased) and finally held out his ring for the soldiers to kiss. There was a mad scramble when everyone tried to kiss the ring and some Englishman started a cheer "Long live the Pope". I didn't get to kiss his ring and I felt that the crowding & pushing was too respectful to him. But he kept smiling and talking to everyone as he made his way to the door. He would say "You're ten American. "We are all one." And so the audience ended. I managed to get two of the rosaries that he gave, but one of these rosaries I sent to my Dad and the other I kept.

Outside again we drove around the city to see the sights. The coliseum parts of columns, ancient ruins were surrounded by the most modern buildings and sights. We saw the balcony from which Mussolini liked to speak! and the square in front of it.

Modern structures, crowded to overflowing hugged up & down the streets. You & then one would see a privately owned vehicle. Beautiful apartment buildings were all over the place. We saw the Tiber river and the seven hills on which Rome is built. And then home. Not much time but I saw many of the things I wanted to see.

Darling I'm including a pressed flower in this letter that came from Nuremberg in Germany. This flower was found in a German letter we picked up. It is quite a souvenir. You might put it with the rest of the pressed flowers & mark what it is.

Well honey it is about time to close this letter. Remember always that I love you very very much and hope to be with you very soon. Keep praying for me & loving me. A hug & a kiss for Patsy from daddy. Your loving & devoted husband

John
