## HISTORY OF SANTA SUSANNA'S CHURCH

Susanna, the daughter of Gabinius was born in Rome about 272A.D. She lived on the Quirinal Hill, not far from the great Baths of Diocletian, until the year 290. On August 11th of that year, because she refused to break her vow of virginity and marry Maxentius, the heir and adopted son of the Emperor, she was beheaded in her home, at the order of Diocletian.

After her martyrdom and that of her Father, her uncle Pope Caius, dedicated the house as an Oratory for public worship. The present Church is built upon the site of this Oratory.

It is said that the Empress Serena, when she heard of the martyrdom of Susanna, went to the house anointed the body and buried it in the Cemetery of Alexander. Later on, the bodies of Susanna and Gabinius her Father, were brought back and placed in the Oratory. They now rest in the same position underneath the altar or the crypt in the Church of Santa Susanna.
