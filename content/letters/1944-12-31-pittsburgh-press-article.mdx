December 31, 1944

*The following article was written by Lieutenant Commander Musmanno, Navy Liaison Officer, and published in the Pittsburgh Press. Lt. Commander Musmanno in civilian life was a Judge in Pittsburgh as well as being an author of considerable note. Included among his books is "Black Fury" which enjoyed a wide circulation as well as having been made into a movie. Lt. Commander Musmanno has visited all Batteries in the Battalion at different times. He was our New Years guest during his last visit and he visited both Batteries "B" and "C" at the time. One of the greatest thrills of his military career was in pulling the lanyard several times in Battery "B" on New Years Day. The Judge is quite fascinated by our "Long Toms" and he has become quite a booster for both our guns and our Battalion. Though many of the incidents in the article are somewhat exaggerated, the appreciation of our material is very well expressed. Copies of this extract are made for your information, and may be sent home through the mails if you so desire. The article follows:*

## NEW YEARS EVE: Italian War Front Style

**By M. A. MUSMANNO**

*(Judge Musmanno, now with the armed forces in Italy, tells about fraternizing with a battery of Long Toms, on the eve of 1945)*

IT IS NEW YEARS EVE. If I were at home this evening I would possibly at this moment be making arrangements for an all-night session of court. In every likelihood I will not go to bed tonight either, but the dark hours will not be consumed in hearing drunken driver cases! And then perhaps there are no more drunken drivers in Pittsburgh.

I am with an artillery outfit and I have been fraternizing with a battery of Long Toms. It never occurred to me in the days of peace that one day I could be wildly enthusiastic over a cannon. I can easily understand why the gun crew of the Long Tom, which is my particular pet, keeps cleaning and polishing it as if it were a horse, although it is more the size of a locomotive. Its entire reliability, amazing precision, gracefulness in action, and dignity in repose are such as to make it a real thoroughbred among large ordnance. It has also earned the sobriquet of "Whispering Death" because when one of its shells passes by, it sounds like the whisper of Old Father Time foreclosing his mortgage prematurely, without notice or indulgent delay.

If you are standing close to the piece when it is fired, you can believe that your ear drums have been shattered, so shattering is the roar that accompanies the terrific explosion of powder needed to send the heavy projectile on its lethal way. Soldiers handling the gun wear cotton in their ears and face away from the breach at the time the lanyard is pulled. Veteran artillery men know how to avoid the concussion effect of the jarring explosion by standing on tiptoe and holding the mouth wide open. This, according to a medic I know, equalizes the ear pressure through the eustachian tube.

WHEN THE TARGET is announced, Long Tom lays back his ears and eagerly tenses for the action. Data on the position and nature of the target comes in continually from various sources. This afternoon our radio telephone picked up a German officer's conversation. I listened in but I could not understand what he was talking about. I only know three German words but these three never occurred together in the sequence of his speech. From time to time I would catch one of them but it was always so intermeshed with other kraut verbiage that I could not decipher its purpose. However, from the intonation of his voice I gathered very easily that this particular German was not wishing me or my GI companions a Happy New Year.

In fact, shortly thereafter he emphasized his unpleasant new year greetings with a shell which whizzed over our heads and landed about a hundred yards away in the open ground. And that as I stood watching, two more shells landed at the same small brush just outside the doorless door and hands it to me as a good luck charm, of which already I have a heavensful.

AT MIDNIGHT we gather to drink a toast to the New Year and sing "Auld Lang Syne" on the Old. A number of Italian officers commanding the miscellaneous battalion stationed nearby happen to be here tonight.
