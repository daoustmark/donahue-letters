Dearest Marie

Just a little extra note with a few souvenirs I've been holding for some time. I have some more but I was able to enclose these in this envelope without trouble.

Just finished writing an air mail letter so I have nothing to write about. Hope you are OK, in good health and happy. Remember, honey, I love you with all my heart & soul. Keep a stiff upper lip and your chin, high in the air.

I love you sweetheart

John
