HENRY TRAXLER, CITY MANAGER COUNCIL-MANAGER GOVERNMENT

February 19, 1945

Dear girls:

Gee I was so happy to have you with me last week-end and hope you all thought the trip worth-while, but next time it will to in warmer weather and you will have to stay longer. Just seemed to me you swived and left right away. I missed out on most of the gore by flitting hither and yon most of the time - but it certainly helped me over a lonesome week-end. Flo and Giso stayed till Sunday night and I certainly enjoyed them and wish more of you could have stayed.

My newest news is that Doc and his boys arrived safely in the Philipines about the first of February - rec'd my first letter the Monday after you were here. He can't tell me where he is but said they were near the 10th Corp and he had driven fix miles in a jeep and visited Major Wu-Sherman - you all will remember him and Esther. He also said they stopped where the 32nd were but didn't go ashore. They are all busy building roads, unloading ships, etc and he feels himself and his boys the "labor battalion" but suppose they will get to slaying when things settle down over there. Half a dozen of the boys were taken ill soon after arrival. Ervin Jr included, but seem to have licked it and now Doc is down. Haven't heard for three days so imagine he is worse than he is letting on - fever and dysentary mostly he says but I'm scared to death its Malaria. He says when they bring in the Jap prisoners, and they are sorry looking things, the Philipinos want to tear them limb from limb and have to be forcibly restrained, and he can understand that. They get paid in Pesos and centavos, and he has sent me some and also some worthless Japanese Invasion money. The Philipinos can't do enough for them and won't take money in return - just a cigarette or any old clothes or food. Doc feels so sorry for them he can hardly eat, so I have sent half a dozen boxes of food and old clothing the past week.

Hope you all have good news of your husbands, and I want to thank every one of you for coming and for the lovely gifts. I didn't expect them, but since you brought them I do thank you and love every one of them. Have my orchid in a book - pressing.

I went to Reedsburg and spent most last week-end and am expecting rooting company from Milwaukee this week end. I have Thursday, Washington's Birthday off so will get caught up. Glee I hope you found your children O.K. and their burns healed. Thats is a "ditto" letter for if I write each individually you probably won't hear from me. Let me hear from some of you occasionally and I'll come to Milwaukee my first opportunity. Am getting kinda anxious to get in - much love to all, Lutie
