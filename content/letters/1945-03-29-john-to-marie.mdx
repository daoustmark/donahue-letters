March 29, 1945

Dearest Marie & Patsy,

Just an extra little note to help fill your mail bag and to summarize for you the trip I took to see Jim. During the time I was traveling to see him, I wrote only V-mails and judging from my dislike of that type of mail I can appreciate that you were not too well pleased. However I also know that you realized the situation and forgave me for not writing air mail.

But to start the story of my odyssey I will tell you how it all came about. I spoke several times of Jim in the presence of the colonel, and finally he asked me if I would like to see my brother on the next leave that I took. He said that he would arrange to get me orders that would authorize me to go to the place he was stationed. Well I seized the opportunity because I realized that it would be about the last chance I would have before Jim completed his tour & went home. So the orders came through and I was off on the trip.

From the outfit to Rome, I travelled with Capt Biehn in a jeep and we arrived in the city about two o'clock in the morning. I manage to get a room with Biehn and we both took a hot bath and went to bed thoroughly exhausted after our long ride. The next morning I had breakfast and went out on the search for a priority on a plane from there to where Jim was. I tried several places during that day and was about to give up when I was routed to a Captain whose acquaintance I had made some time before under combat conditions. He said that he would give me the necessary orders to fly and you can be sure that I was mighty happy.

The next noon I boarded a plane and started the first leg of my journey. Wonderful travelling by air. I enjoyed it very much. But on the first stop, Naples, I was forced to stay over night. I caught an early plane the next morning and 8th that morning arrived at my destination. But I found that I had just started my search. Found one small outfit among so many was like looking for a needle in a haystack. Finally hit upon the plan of getting a room in a hotel and going out to search without all my impedimenta. So I checked in at a hotel and started out through the city on foot.

After walking for about a half hour, I noticed the sign Militarypolice and decided to have a look in their headquarter to see if they could help me. They were more than nice to me. The Officer in charge gave me a vehicle and drove, and told me I could use it until I found my brother. There are some swell people in this world - right?

Well to make a long story short, I finally located his outfit some twenty-five miles from the town and I arrived just in time for mess. Also found out that Jim was on a mission and would not return for some two hours. But I was able to spend the hours very nicely with Jim's Commanding Officer. When the time came we drove out to the landing area to "sweat" the planes in. We watched the whole thing and finally they told me, your brother is on that plane. So we jumped in his vehicle and raced off to the parking place for that plane. We arrived just in time to see the crew emerge from the plane. As Jim came out I tapped him on the shoulder & said: "Hello Jim how are you?" Jimmy was he surprised.

Well they took him off to the questioning period and I was allowed to sit in. After it was over, the commanding officer gave Jim a pass and told me I could use his vehicle to go back to town. (More swell people). Jim was all elated and happy. I went down to his quarters, met his buddies and talked while he changed clothes. Then we took the vehicle & went off to town.

Well, we talked for a long while in my room and then decided to take in a boxing match presented by the Red Cross. It was fun being there together. After that Jim went to his quarters and I went back to the hotel with plans to meet early the next morning.

I met Jim early the next morning. Poor fellow had not done so well with getting sleeping quarters. They gave him six blankets and he slept on some hard boards. But he did not complain and he had eaten a good breakfast. Well we stayed in my room until almost eleven o'clock talking about Penny, you & Patsy, dad & the girls, Don & Casey, and a lot of others. After that we took a walk about the town and decided to take in a movie in the afternoon. We also found a GI restaurant where Jim could eat. We met again immediately after lunch & went to a Red Cross theater where we saw Rhapsody in Blue, a very good movie. After the movie we went back to the room and spent some more time together. I showed him all the pictures I had.

That evening we attended a U.S.O. show, the second I had seen since I have been here. It was quite good. After the show we spent some more time together just talking. Its lot of fun to talk to someone near to you.

The next morning we met at the air terminal that I had to leave from. There I found my plane did not leave until noon. So we spent the time visiting and playing ping-pong in the waiting room of the terminal. It was a real good morning. At mid-morning we had a snack at the snack bar and talked some more. When the time came I guess we were about talked out.

Well, honey, I thought that it would require two days to return but due to a lucky break I got back to where I had left Don Biehn that same afternoon. I got myself a separate room this time and took a good bath. So I spent two nights and one day there just resting and enjoying all the luxury of the facilities there. The next night I saw a ballet which I have already told you about. And the morning after that we started the long trip back to the front.

Well honey Jim & I did not do very much during the time we were together but it gave me a chance to satisfy part of the longing we have to see home again. The mere fact that I was able to talk to someone who knew the same people, who was associated with the thoughts of Milwaukee, of you, of Patsy, made the hours we spent together very nice. I think both of us felt better for it. Can you imagine the lift that gave one. I think you can well understand.

Well honey this has not been much of a letter. Probably it is very dry for you to read but I promised a promise & I said I would write the account of my trip.

Love & kisses to the sweetest wife & sweetheart in the world. Your loving & devoted

John
