May 8, 1945 Official V-E Day

Dearest Marie & Patsy

Honey I know that you are as happy as I am today in a sober and thoughtful sort of way. I am thinking today of the long time we have been apart and wondering, darling, if this spells the end for me in the service of my country. I'm thinking back to the long hard days of training and the harsh days of combat. I'm thinking of all those fine, young American boys I saw die for their country. And especially am I thinking of the wonderful way Providence has protected me throughout the most dangerous days. Naturally I cannot avoid the inescapable conclusion that God has protected me and preserved me. And for that, honey, we must both today raise our hearts to God & His Mother, in thanksgiving. Thank you God for your protection.

But, honey, it was not my prayers that made this possible. It was the storm of prayers sent up by you, your folks and my folks in my behalf. In the face of such incessant prayer, there was no alternative for a loving God.

Tomorrow is an official holiday celebrating the victory. We are going to observe it by having a memorial service for the battalion in remembrance of the boys who have died and have been wounded. Everyone is gathering together in their best bib and tucker to pay a slight tribute to our comrades who have passed on. I will tell you more about that tomorrow.

Had a marvelous trip yesterday to a nearby city just to see the sights. I had a marvelous time just enjoying the sights. The only thing to mar this was quite limited. But I did have a ride in a gondola and I saw the famous church located there. It was an interesting experience and the only trouble was that we should have about a week in the place to properly look about. I did have the opportunity to buy a linen piece which is very well done. I think that you will appreciate it, very much.

The countryside at this time of the year is especially beautiful. There are a lot of flowers from roses to daisies, everything is green and colorful and the air is fresh with the smell of fresh flowers. While the sun is very hot, the air is cool and the temperature never rises too high. It is a wonderful thing.

Had a shower today with a change of clothes complete. Really feels good to have a nice warm shower and all the trimmings. After I returned I had the shirt altered and epaulets put on it by a tailor near by. He did a really swell job.

Had chicken for mess tonight with dumplings and corn. This morning we had pancakes for breakfast, and at noon sandwich spread and hash. It was quite a good day for meals.

Well, honey, we must keep up our prayers now for my early return to you & civilian life. Prayer can accomplish wonders and I'm sure that I have a pretty good chance of getting out of the army. There will be many who have a desire to stay on, I think - I hope.

Honey I love you more than ever every day. I want to hold you in my arms soon. Love & kisses from your loving & devoted husband

John

I love you dearly.
