Dearest Marie & Patsy

Hello, honey, this is it, the letter you have been waiting for. I leave here on Friday to go to the final place in Italy. Expect to spend anywhere from a week to ten days there and then the boat and home. When you receive this letter you may stop writing if you so wish. I will continue to write for a little while yet advising you of the events as they happen. Isn't it wonderful the war is over. I'm on my way and the feast of the Assumption, all in one. Can't complain, but ship has finally come in and it looks like it won't be long until I will be seeing you again. Gee honey I'm so excited I can't think.

Sent out a box with some equipment in it today. Have another with shoes & boots left for tomorrow. My belongings are very few now. Don't care to have very much because it looks like I will be able to get out of the army. A happy day. Just pray now that I get a fast ship and makes the journey safely. OK.

Saw a peculiar movie tonight called Bewitched. It was really quite strange but very interesting. But anything would be good these days. I'm happy as a lark and twice as peppy.

Bought a book of watercolors on Pinoche for Patsy. After all she is our beautiful little twelve forty. Without her, I would be staying here. Twelve points for going home. Am I going to love her for that. A boy.

Well honey I'll close now with loads of love & kisses to you and Patsy from your loving & devoted husband

John

I love you.

Pictures enclosed.
